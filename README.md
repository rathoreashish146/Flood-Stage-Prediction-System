Project Overview
Floods are one of the most destructive natural disasters that can lead to loss of life, property damage, and economic impact. Predicting flood stages accurately is crucial for effective disaster management and mitigation. This project aims to create a system that can predict flood stages based on historical data, weather information, and other relevant factors.

Features
Data Collection: The project involves collecting historical flood data, weather data, river levels, and any other relevant data sources.

Data Preprocessing: The collected data will be cleaned, transformed, and prepared for model training.

Model Development: Various deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM, GRU, and other models will be developed and trained using the prepared data.

Model Evaluation: The performance of each model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their predictive accuracy.

Model Integration: The best-performing models will be integrated into a unified system for flood stage prediction.

User Interface: A user-friendly interface will be created to allow users to input relevant data and obtain flood stage predictions.
